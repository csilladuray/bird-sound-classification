## Abstract
Our project focused on the exploration of large audio model pruning, investigating the redundancy inside their layers in a specific bioacoustic task. Bioacoustics is a rapidly evolving field since the application of machine learning models for monitoring biodiversity. Transformer models that are finetuned for downstream tasks, such as the classification of various species based on audio data, may be pruned for optimised inference time, while retaining their performance. Here, we demonstrate the pruning process of a wav2vec2 model fine-tuned for a bird sound classification task. We rely on various similarity metrics and convexity measures to do so, and compare our final model performance with baseline models such as a simple CNN and the feature extractor.
